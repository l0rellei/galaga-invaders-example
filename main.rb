Reflecting on Principle
1) How are Ruby modules (and similar features from other langs)
   different from a class, in their purpose?
2) What is LSP?
3) Briefly describe how the template method pattern works.

1) Modules contain methods that applies to 
all classes that use it. Modules
contain methods for shared 
behaviour of classes.
2) The Liskov Substitution Principle
specifies that a superclass 
function can be used by a subclass. A 
function that is valid for a 
superclass is also valid for a subclass of
that superclass.
3) It abstracts the code, (duplicated patterns)that 
classes use.
